# Waterrarium

Waterrarium is a tamogatchi-like browser game where you own your own aquarium! Currently there are 10 species of fish in the application. Fish receive randomized moods that allow you to interact with them in different ways. Certain actions play sound effects, such as adding a fish or clicking one.

# Background

Ths application was created out of a love for video games, especially ones made with pixel art. I wanted to make something fun while also utilizing many of the different things that libraries allow you to do in React. Additionally, I wanted to become versed in using CSS, including keyframes animations. It is my dream to one day become a solo developer, so I wanted to become comfortable integrating assets into a project.

# Website

**Application is deployed [here!](https://www.waterrarium.com/)**

# Current Stretch Goals

- Create more customized animatons with keyframes in CSS
- Add more soundfx and/or music
- Allow user to visit other users' aquariums/send notes
- More fish species
